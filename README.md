# bikeshare_timeseries_analysis
In this project I perform analysis on 2011 capital bikeshare data.

Using Jupyter Notebook I explore the data provided by kaggle and create visualisations to help understand the relationship between each factor.

The Libraries I used for the analysis are: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Numpy.
